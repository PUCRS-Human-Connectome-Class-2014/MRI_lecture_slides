# Magnetism

<center><img src="imgs/magneticFieldLines1.gif"></center>

- **Magnetism** is a force exerted by magnets, or moving electric charge, on other magnets
- **Magnets** are materials or objects that produce magnetic fields
- Magnets only exist as **dipoles**, with north and south poles, similar poles of different magnets repel one another, opposite poles attract

# Magnetic Field

- A **Magnetic Field** describes the influence of a magnet on its surroundings
- **Maxwell's correction to Amp√®re's law** - A changing electric field, such as a current through a loop of wire, will generate a magnetic field (**Electromagnet**)
- **Faraday's Law** - A changing magnetic field, such as through a conductor, generates an electric field, that will drive a current in that conductor (**Receiver Coil**)
- **Lenz's Law** - The generated current will flow in a direction to generate a magnetic field which *opposes* the applied field

- what is a magnetic field?
    - materials/objects in a magnetic field align with the field
    - magnetic fields can be generated by electrical currents
    - moving magnetic fields can produce current in a wire
    - Lorenz's law
    - Faraday's law
- how does the strength of a magnetic field compare with other forces?
- define ferromagnetic, diamagnetic, paramagnetic, non-magnetic
- define magnetic susceptibility

# Magnetic moments of atoms
- Atoms have "spin" which imparts a magnetic moment
    - gyromagnetic ratio
    - larmar frequencey
    - where is the larmor frequency on the spectrum
- Atoms preferentially align themselves with magnetic fields
    - equation
- Using an externally applied magnetic field, receive coil, and electronics can record current generated by spins and analyze the spectrum to determine the constituent elements in a sample - Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
- Using a homogenous sample of known makeup (i.e. purified water), a receive coil, and electronics can measure the strenght of an external magnetic field - Proton Spin Magnetometer

# Magnetic resonance imaging
- magnetic resonance imaging focuses on the density of Hydrogen
    - one of the most abundant elements in the human body (is it the most)
    - spin 1/2, simplifies the physics
- Uses "flip" to generate signal that is perpendicular to magnetic field and selectively excite hydrogen protons
   - Mxy vs. Mz
- Can measure proton density from the strength of the resulting signal - show equation again
    - But proton density for different tissues in the brain and body are similar - no contrast
    - instead can rely on T1 and T2, T2* phenomena
        - T1 is the loss of signal in Mxy due to the realignment of proton with magnetic field
        - T2* is the loss of signal in Mxy due to dephasing
            - Motion (T2)
            - Inhomogeneity (T2*)
- Spatial encoding can be accomplished by spatially-varying magnetic fields
    - change in magnetic field results in different larmor frequency
        - using flip can selectively excite
        - similar to MRS and proton spin magnetometer, frequency of spin can be used to determine location of spins
- Basics of MRI machine
    - Big Magnet, gradient coils, RF coils, power amplifiers, electronics, etc ...
- Basics of MRI sequences
    - FLASH, gradient echo
    - spin echo
    - magnetisation preparation
    - echo planar imaging
